# UnityPipes
An endless running game. My first functional game in Unity. This game was about 50% based on the "SwirlyPipe" tutorial by 
[Catlike Coding](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/swirly-pipe/), with the main modifications being extra functionality in game, 
and using my preferred object abstraction style and the addition of a very barebones UI. 

## How to play?
[Link to Game](https://heartworm.github.io/unitypipes/index.html)

- You will move through randomly generated pipes, and your task is to avoid the obstacles along the way. 
- Move the mouse horizontally to rotate the player. 
- The rate of movement will increase as the game progresses, making it harder to avoid obstacles. 
- Click the mouse to enter a "negative" mode, where obstacles now heal you, however your health will instead decay over time.
- You have to commit to this decision, only being able to change between the two modes (by clicking) after a set cooldown period.
