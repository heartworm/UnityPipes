# UnityPipes
An endless running game. My first functional game in Unity. This game was about 50% based on the "SwirlyPipe" tutorial by 
[Catlike Coding](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/swirly-pipe/), with the main modifications being extra functionality in game, 
using my preferred object abstraction style and the addition of a very barebones UI. 

## How to play?

- You will move through randomly generated pipes, and your task is to avoid the obstacles along the way. 
- Grazing (very nearly hitting) obstacles will earn you 50 extra points.
- Use the Left and Right arrow keys to rotate the player. Hold "Left CTRL" while moving to slow down the rotation (useful to get graze points). 
- The pipe travel speed will increase as the game progresses, making it harder to avoid obstacles.
- Press "Left SHIFT" to enter a "negative" mode, where obstacles now heal you, however your health will instead decay over time.
- You have to commit to this decision, only being able to change between the two modes (by pressing "Left SHIFT") after a set cooldown period (3 seconds).
